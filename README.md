# GeneralWasteDataModel
<p>Proposes a General Data Model to Describe how resources (and waste) flow in a city-region.</p>

<ul>
<li>Any socio-economic activity happening within an urban/regional system need, use and interact with a set of support systems.</li>
  <ul>
  <li>Physical support systems such as the road and electricity network</li>
  <li>Institutional support system as the set of laws and regulations that determine how a system should behave</li>
  <li>Socio-cultural support system that determine how the citizens interact with the system</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>Resources (and secondary ones) can be:</li>
  <ol>
  <li>Generated</li>
  <li>Used</li>
  <li>Transformed</li>
  <li>Stored</li>
  </ol> 
</ul> 
In most of cases after one of these actions is executed the resources, goods or waste materials are moved from one place to another


## Conceptual framework of secondary resources in city-regions
![ConceptualModel](https://github.com/Urban-JonathanCohen/GeneralWasteDataModel/blob/main/Conceptual/concept1.PNG)

### Main components

<ol>
<li>Generation: Every time there is a process, a by-product is generated. Waste means any substance or object which the holder discards or intends or is required to discard. It has no value. It cannot purchase or sold.</li>
<li>Transformation: By various means any waste or part of it can be transformed into a resource that can be re-introduced in the market for its use.
Storage: When ever waste materials are stored over time. </li>
<li>Usage: After upgrading a by-product, it could be used by another or the same industry.</li>
<li>
Transport: Every time a waste material is moved from one container to another, there is need for transportation</li>
</ol> 


## Adding necessary components to describe the system

<ol>
<li>Containers: Is the physical object or place that contains the waste</li>
<li>Support systems: Are the geographical and socio-economic systems that allow and determine activities in the territory</li>
</ol>
